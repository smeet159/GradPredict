Predicting chances of admit from important parameters like GRE scrore and TOEFL score etc.

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.<br/>The parameters included are : <br/>1. GRE Scores ( out of 340 ) <br/>2. TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 ) <br/>3. University Rating ( out of 5 )<br/> 4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )<br/> 5. Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )<br/> 6. Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )<br/> 7. Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )<br/>

I've used Linear regression model , decision-tree regressor and random forest regressor to find the chances of admit in the university given all the above parameters and also compared the efficiency of those models.
