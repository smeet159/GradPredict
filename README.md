Predicting chances of admit from important parameters like GRE scrore and TOEFL score etc for an international student.

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.<br/>The parameters included are : <br/>1. GRE Scores ( out of 340 ) <br/>2. TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 ) <br/>3. University Rating ( out of 5 )<br/> 4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )<br/> 5. Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )<br/> 6. Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )<br/> 7. Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )<br/>

I've used Linear regression model , decision-tree regressor and random forest regressor to find the chances of admit in the university given all the above parameters and also compared the efficiency of those models.
